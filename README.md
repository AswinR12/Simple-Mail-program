# Simple-Mail-program

This is a simple python script that can be used to send Emails to multiple people. You can add attachments to the mail if needed.
Note that you may have to configure your email settings depending on the service you use.
Most personal email services have instructions for sending email through SMTP; just search for the name of your email service and "SMTP connection settings".
